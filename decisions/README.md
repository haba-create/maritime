# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview
This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document important decisions made during the development and evolution of our data platform. Each ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of architectural choices.

## ADR Process

### When to Create an ADR
Create an ADR when making decisions that:
- Affect the structural properties of the system
- Are expensive to change later
- Have significant impact on non-functional requirements
- Involve trade-offs between competing concerns
- Set important precedents for future decisions

### ADR Template
Use the [ADR template](adr-template.md) for consistency. Each ADR should include:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that led to this decision
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Consequences**: The results of this decision

### ADR Lifecycle
1. **Draft**: Initial version, under discussion
2. **Proposed**: Ready for review and decision
3. **Accepted**: Approved and implemented
4. **Deprecated**: No longer recommended
5. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR

## ADR Review Process

### Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Review all Proposed ADRs
- **Quarterly**: Review all Accepted ADRs for relevance
- **Annually**: Comprehensive review of entire ADR catalog

### Review Committee
| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Chief Architect** | Final decision authority |
| **Principal Engineers** | Technical review and recommendations |
| **Product Managers** | Business impact assessment |
| **Security Team** | Security and compliance review |
| **Operations Team** | Operational impact assessment |

### Review Criteria
1. **Technical Feasibility**: Can this be implemented with our current capabilities?
2. **Business Alignment**: Does this support our business objectives?
3. **Risk Assessment**: What are the technical and business risks?
4. **Resource Impact**: What resources (time, money, people) are required?
5. **Long-term Implications**: How will this affect future decisions?

## ADR Guidelines

### Writing Guidelines
- **Be Concise**: ADRs should be easy to read and understand
- **Be Specific**: Include concrete details and examples
- **Be Honest**: Document both benefits and drawbacks
- **Be Timely**: Create ADRs close to when decisions are made

### Decision Criteria
Consider these factors when making architectural decisions:
- **Performance**: How will this affect system performance?
- **Scalability**: Can this scale with our growth?
- **Maintainability**: How easy is this to maintain long-term?
- **Security**: What are the security implications?
- **Cost**: What are the total costs (licensing, infrastructure, personnel)?
- **Vendor Risk**: Are we creating vendor lock-in?
- **Team Expertise**: Do we have the skills to implement and maintain this?

### Common Decision Patterns

#### Technology Selection
1. Evaluate multiple options against defined criteria
2. Create proof of concept for top candidates
3. Document trade-offs and rationale
4. Consider exit strategies and migration paths

#### Architecture Patterns
1. Start with industry best practices
2. Adapt to our specific context and constraints
3. Document deviations from standards
4. Plan for evolution and migration

#### Process Decisions
1. Consider team size and distribution
2. Factor in existing tooling and expertise
3. Plan for onboarding and training
4. Define success metrics

## FAQ

### How do I create a new ADR?
1. Copy the [ADR template](templates/adr-template.md)
2. Fill in the sections with your decision details
3. Assign the next available ADR number
4. Submit for review through pull request

### When should an ADR be deprecated?
- When a better solution is found
- When requirements change significantly
- When technology becomes obsolete
- When security vulnerabilities are discovered

### How do I reference an ADR?
Use the format: ADR-XXX (Title), e.g., "As specified in ADR-001 (Snowflake as Primary Data Warehouse)"

### Can ADRs be changed after acceptance?
Minor clarifications can be made, but substantial changes should result in a new ADR that supersedes the original.
