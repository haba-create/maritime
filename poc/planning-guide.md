A POC is a small-scale, preliminary study conducted to evaluate the feasibility of a concept, technology, or approach before full-scale implementation.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Validate technical feasibility
- Demonstrate business value
- Identify potential risks and challenges
- Inform go/no-go decisions
- Refine requirements and estimates

## Best Practices

### Technical Best Practices
1. **Keep It Simple**: Focus on core functionality only
2. **Use Familiar Technologies**: Minimize learning curve
3. **Plan for Throwaway Code**: POC code may not be production-ready
4. **Document Assumptions**: Record all assumptions and decisions
5. **Test Early and Often**: Validate approach continuously

### Project Management Best Practices
1. **Time-box Strictly**: Don't let POC drag on indefinitely
2. **Manage Expectations**: Be clear about POC limitations
3. **Regular Checkpoints**: Frequent go/no-go decision points
4. **Focus on Learning**: Prioritize learning over perfection
5. **Plan for Pivot**: Be ready to change direction based on findings

### Communication Best Practices
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep stakeholders informed
2. **Show, Don't Tell**: Use demos and prototypes
3. **Be Honest About Limitations**: Don't oversell capabilities
4. **Gather Feedback Early**: Involve users in the process
5. **Document Everything**: Capture all learnings and decisions
